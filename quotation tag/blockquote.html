    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Glioblastoma (GBM) infiltrates the brain and can be synaptically innervated by neurons, which drives tumor progression1,2. Synaptic inputs onto GBM cells identified so far are largely short-range and glutamatergic3,4. The extent of GBM integration into the brain-wide neuronal circuitry remains unclear. Here we applied rabies virus- and herpes simplex virus-mediated trans-monosynaptic tracing5,6 to systematically investigate circuit integration of human GBM organoids transplanted into adult mice. We found that GBM cells from multiple patients </p>
